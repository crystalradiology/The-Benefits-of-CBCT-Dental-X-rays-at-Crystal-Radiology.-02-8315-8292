CBCT is an abbreviation for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography. This advanced imaging technology uses a cone-shaped X-ray beam that rotates around the patient, capturing up to 200 images at various angles in less than a minute. These images are then compiled using specialized software to create a detailed 3D reconstruction of the mouth, jaw, ear, nose, and throat.
Compared to traditional 2D X-rays, CBCT scans provide a more comprehensive and precise view, making them invaluable for certain dental procedures such as implant therapy and root canal treatment. This cutting-edge technology enhances diagnosis and treatment planning, especially in complex dental cases.
Benefits of CBCT Scans
•	Highly Detailed 3D Imagery
CBCT scans provide an unparalleled level of detail, allowing dentists to thoroughly assess oral structures, including bone density, nerve pathways, and sinus cavities. This helps in achieving more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.
•	Comprehensive Oral Health Assessment
Unlike standard dental X-rays, CBCT scans offer a complete view of the patient’s oral structures, helping dentists gain a deeper understanding of overall dental health. This can be particularly beneficial in cases involving orthodontics, TMJ disorders, and sinus evaluations.
•	Quick and Painless Procedure
A full-mouth CBCT scan takes less than 40 seconds to complete. The process is entirely non-invasive, ensuring a comfortable experience for patients without the need for any special preparation.
•	Lower Radiation Exposure
While CBCT scans do involve radiation exposure, the dose is significantly lower than that of traditional medical CT scans. This makes CBCT a safer option for obtaining high-resolution images while minimizing potential risks.
•	Broader Range of Evaluations
      CBCT technology allows for the evaluation of a wider array of oral structures, including:
•	Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) conditions
•	Maxillary sinuses
•	Impacted teeth
•	Jaw abnormalities
When Are CBCT Scans Used?
Your dentist may recommend a CBCT scan after discussing its benefits and risks with you. Some of the most common reasons for needing a CBCT scan include:
•	Complex Dental Issues
CBCT scans help in diagnosing intricate dental problems that may not be visible on conventional X-rays. This is particularly useful for detecting infections, fractures, or hidden abnormalities.
•	Endodontic (Root Canal) Treatment
For complex root canal cases, CBCT scans offer a detailed view of the tooth’s internal structures, ensuring more precise treatment planning and better long-term outcomes.
•	Post-Trauma Assessment
If a patient has suffered a facial or jaw injury, CBCT imaging is used to assess the extent of the damage and formulate a treatment plan accordingly.
•	Pre-Surgical Planning for Tooth Extractions
Before performing wisdom tooth extractions or other complex dental surgeries, CBCT scans allow dentists to visualize the tooth’s position and relationship to surrounding structures.
•	Dental Implant Planning
One of the most significant uses of CBCT technology is in dental implant placement. The scan helps determine bone quality and quantity, as well as the precise positioning of implants while avoiding nerves and other critical structures.
•	Diagnosis of TMJ Disorders
CBCT scans provide detailed images of the temporomandibular joint, helping dentists diagnose and manage TMJ disorders effectively.
•	Oral Development in Children and Young Adults
For younger patients, CBCT imaging is an excellent tool for tracking the development of teeth and jaw structures, aiding in early orthodontic planning.

At Crystal Radiology, we are committed to utilizing state-of-the-art CBCT technology to provide our patients with the highest quality diagnostic imaging. Our advanced imaging suite allows us to capture high-resolution digital images, aiding in precise treatment planning and improved patient outcomes.
By incorporating CBCT scans into our practice, we enhance the accuracy of various dental procedures, ensuring optimal care for our patients. Whether you require a scan for implant planning, orthodontics, or complex dental cases, Crystal Radiology is equipped to meet your needs with efficiency and precision.
How Long Does a CBCT Scan Take?
CBCT scans are conducted in our dedicated Imaging Suite and typically take between 20-40 seconds to complete a full-mouth scan. Since this is a non-invasive procedure, patients experience no discomfort.
When you arrive at Crystal Radiology, you will have a brief consultation with your dentist before the scan. You may be asked to remove any metal objects, such as jewellery, as they can interfere with the imaging process. Remaining still during the scan ensures the highest quality images.
Are There Any Risks?
As with any dental X-ray, CBCT scans expose patients to a small amount of radiation. While the radiation dose is slightly higher than that of traditional dental X-rays, it is significantly lower than that of conventional medical CT scans.
